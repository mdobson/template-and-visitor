#Template Method and Visitor Patterns

This repo gives a small taste of what you can do with the template method pattern and the visitor pattern.

The `template-method` directory shows us how overriding implementation in a base class can allow us to extend a flow of logic in a process.

The `visitor` directory implements the worlds smallest programming language making it easy to add numbers.
